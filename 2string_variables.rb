# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first_name = "Dan "

# p first_name + last_name


# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "Dan"
# last_name = "Cross"

# puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"


# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# p "Enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).


# color_1 = "pink"
# color_2 = "red"
# color_3 = "purple"

# p "The three colors are " + color_1 + ", " + color_2 + ", and " + color_3 + "."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
