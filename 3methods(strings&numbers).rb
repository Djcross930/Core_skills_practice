# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# if number > 100
#   p "That's a big number!"
# end




# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# array = []
# 2.times do
#   p "Enter two numbers:"
#   array << gets.chomp.to_i
# end

# p array.sum






# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.


# p "Enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.reverse






# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# p "Enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# p number * 10





# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

#   p "Enter a word:"
#   array << gets.chomp
# end

# p array[0].upcase + " " + array[1].upcase

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# p "Enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# if number < 0
#   p "That's a negative number!"
# end


# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

#   p "Insert a number:"
#   array << gets.chomp.to_i
# end

# p array[0] * array[1]


# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
